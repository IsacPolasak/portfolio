                        <h4>Understanding The Problem and the User</h4>
                        <h5>Before conducting research</h5>
                        <p>I assumed parents wanted their kids to have a screen-free way to stay connected with their parents and make routines easier.</p>
                        <h5>Through user interviews and observation</h5>
                        <p>I confirmed many struggled to balance busy schedules with quality bonding moments. A mom of a five-year-old shared how hard it was to maintain a consistent bedtime routine when she worked late shifts. She wanted a comforting, familiar presence her child could rely on when she wasn't there.</p>
                        <h5>In speaking with parents and children</h5>
                        <p>I discovered emotional connection was as important as structure. Parents valued tools that helped with routines, and children responded best to interactions that felt personal with a dash of magic.</p>

                            <p><strong>Screen Time:</strong> Parents want to reduce their children's screen time but struggle to find engaging, screen-free alternatives that still foster connection.</p>
                            <p><strong>Impersonality:</strong> Existing routine and storytelling tools feel impersonal and lack emotional warmth or imaginative play.</p>

                            <p><strong>Routine Through Play:</strong> Children respond more positively to structure when it's delivered through imaginative, character-driven experiences rather than direct instruction.</p>

                            <p>Through research and interviews, a common challenge emerged: busy parents struggle to maintain comforting routines and meaningful connection with their children, while kids miss consistent, engaging interactions. Parents want to reduce screen time but lack tools that bring emotional warmth and playful, personalized moments into daily life. The design challenge is to create an inviting, easy-to-use solution that supports nurturing, screen-free routines and helps parents stay connected with their child, even when apart.</p>

                            <p>From user interviews, it became clear that busy parents struggle to maintain comforting routines while managing hectic schedules. Christina, a nurse and mom of a five-year-old, inspired the persona. She juggles late shifts and family time and wants her child to have a familiar, comforting presence that supports daily routines. She values simple, screen-free solutions that help her stay connected and ease routines without adding complexity.</p>

                                    <p>After finalizing the wireframes, I started linking everything together in Figma to map out the main user flow. I focused on the checkout process: how someone would add something to their cart and actually complete an order. It was a simple way to test how the screens worked together and whether the flow made sense before moving on to any visuals or details. While building the low-fidelity prototype, I focused on keeping the layout simple and the navigation clear, making sure all the key screens connected logically. Since the design was still basic, I concentrated on structure and user flow rather than visuals or detailed content, which helped keep the focus on functionality first.</p>

I revisited each screen with fresh eyes, making changes to the flow, visuals, and microcopy. I incorporated real images, colors, and branding elements, and added more visual hierarchy to key elements. The high-fidelity prototype became a more realistic version of the final product, allowing me to test not just functionality, but how the design felt in a real-world context.</p>

                            <p>After conducting a few usability studies, I noticed that users wanted an easy way to return to stories they had just listened to. In response, I added a “Recently Played” section to the Storytime page. This change allows users to quickly access their most recent stories without needing to search again, making the experience feel more fluid and user-friendly.</p>

                            <p>During testing, it became clear that users wanted more flexibility when interacting with their saved recordings. I updated the Saved Messages page to include the ability to play a message directly from the list, as well as a new “Share” option. These additions made it easier for users to engage with their own content and share it with others, reducing friction and increasing overall usability.</p>

                                <p>Reflecting on the process, I learned a lot more about Figma than I expected, especially how to use overlays and build more advanced interactions in the prototype. I also improved my icon design skills, learning how to create custom icons that matched the tone of the app. Lastly, I also gained a better sense of how to balance creativity with usability, making sure every design choice served a clear purpose. These small details ended up having a big impact on how polished and intuitive the final product felt.</p>
