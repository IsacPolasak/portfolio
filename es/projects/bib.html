                            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Baked in Brooklyn is a popular neighborhood bakery serving affordable breakfast and lunch. During peak hours, long lines and rushed customers make it difficult to customize orders. Staff often feel overwhelmed explaining menu items, and customers don’t have time to wait or ask questions. Patrons just want to order ahead and grab their food on the go.</p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> A mobile app that lets customers explore the menu, customize items easily, and place orders ahead of time, thus reducing in-store wait times, easing staff workload, and improving the overall experience for the workers as well as for locals and tourists alike.</p>

                        <h4>Understanding The Problem and the User</h4>
                        <h5>Before conducting research</h5>
                        <p class="paragraphs">I assumed that the typical bakery customers were busy adults who valued high-quality, affordable food they couldn’t easily make at home, often grabbing breakfast or lunch on the go.</p>
                        <h5>Through user interviews and observation</h5>
                        <p class="paragraphs">I found that most customers were professionals with demanding routines who didn’t have time to wait in long lines or customize orders on the spot. Many expressed frustration during peak hours and wanted a quicker, more convenient way to place their usual orders.</p>
                        <h5>In speaking with staff</h5>
                        <p>I saw how overwhelming the morning rush could be. They often had to explain menu items and manage custom orders under pressure, slowing service and adding stress. These insights revealed a shared pain point: the need for a system that shortens waits and makes mornings easier for everyone.</p>

                            <p>Through research and interviews, it became clear that both customers and staff are frustrated by in-person ordering during rush hours. Customers don't have time to customize on the spot, and staff are overwhelmed by constant clarifications. This leads to long lines, slow service, and stress. Busy Brooklyn customers and bakery staff need a faster, simpler way to place and manage custom orders during peak times.</p>

                            <h4>Developing The Persona</h4>
                            <p>From my user interviews, I found that many customers, especially parents, struggle with time pressure and picky eaters, making food ordering stressful in the mornings. One user inspired the persona of Samantha, a busy mom of two who juggles school drop-offs and work before 9 a.m. She values speed, flexibility, and the ability to customize ahead of time without waiting in line or explaining everything in person. While not "techy," she's open to anything that makes hectic mornings easier.</p>

                            <p>Samantha's typical morning starts with getting her kids ready and out the door by 8:30 AM. She needs to grab breakfast for the family but doesn't have time to wait in Baked in Brooklyn's busy morning line. The current in-store experience creates stress: long waits, difficulty customizing orders for picky eaters, and the pressure of holding up other customers while making decisions on the spot.</p>

                            <p>With a mobile app, Samantha could browse the menu the night before, customize orders for each family member, and schedule pickup for exactly when she needs it. This transforms her morning from stressful to smooth, allowing her to focus on what matters most: getting her family ready and maintaining a positive start to their day.</p>

                                    <p>After finalizing the wireframes, I started linking everything together in Figma to map out the main user flow. I focused on the checkout process: how someone would add something to their cart and actually complete an order. It was a simple way to test how the screens worked together and whether the flow made sense before moving on to any visuals or details. While building the low-fidelity prototype, I focused on keeping the layout simple and the navigation clear, making sure all the key screens connected logically. Since the design was still basic, I concentrated on structure and user flow rather than visuals or detailed content, which helped keep the focus on functionality first.</p>

                                    <p>When creating the high-fidelity prototype, I built on everything I learned from the low-fidelity version and the usability feedback it generated. I revisited each screen with fresh eyes, making changes to the flow, visuals, and microcopy. I incorporated real images, colors, and branding elements, and added more visual hierarchy to key elements. The high-fidelity prototype became a more realistic version of the final product, allowing me to test not just functionality, but how the design felt in a real-world context.</p>

                            <h5>Streamlined Customization Interface</h5>
                            <p>Moving from wireframe to prototype, I changed the customization interface from showing all options as buttons to using a dropdown menu. This change removed visual clutter and made the interface less overwhelming for users who weren't interested in customizing their orders, while still keeping customization easily accessible for those who wanted it.</p>

                            <h5>Persistent Bottom Navigation</h5>
                            <p>Based on feedback from usability studies, I redesigned the bottom navigation to remain "stuck" at the bottom of the screen at all times. Users no longer needed to scroll all the way down the page to find the three-icon menu, making navigation more intuitive and accessible throughout their experience with the app.</p>

                                <p>Looking back on the whole process from digging into user needs, to sketching and prototyping, to testing and tweaking, I learned a lot about what really makes a design work. It showed me how important it is to keep iterating and paying attention to the little things that can make the experience smoother and more enjoyable for users.</p>
